# Crystal Collector

This JavaScript / jQuery game:
* generates a random "goal" number
* uses a for loop to dynamically load images to the page...
* ...and assign random numbers and other attributes to each image
* then adds the number values collected on each user click

If the number reaches the goal number, the user wins.

If the number surpasses the goal, it's a loss.

Wins are tallied until the page is refreshed!
